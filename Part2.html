            <h3>Important Characters</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Guy Montag:</strong> Montag starts to recognize the emptiness of his society. As he faces personal doubt, he questions the purpose of his work and begins to seek deeper meaning, even risking his life to preserve knowledge. (The same as several different Charecters in Chi. Chikyuu no Undou ni Tsuite)</li>
                    <li><strong>Mildred Montag:</strong> Mildred is indifferent to Montag’s awakening. She represents the mindless citizens who live in distraction, focusing on entertainment rather than confronting uncomfortable truths.</li>
                    <li><strong>Captain Beatty:</strong> Beatty is a contradiction. He knows a lot about books but supports burning them. He enforces censorship and control, which causes Montag to question everything.</li>
                    <li><strong>Professor Faber:</strong> Faber is a former professor who, despite his fear of the government, becomes Montag's ally. He teaches Montag how to think critically and fight against oppression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mrs. Phelps:</strong> Phelps embodies the emotional numbness of the society. Her odd breakdown when Montag reads poetry shows the suppressed emotions that the government has tried to erase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mrs. Bowles:</strong> Mrs. Bowles represents the conformist masses, blindly following the values of the dystopian society, even at the expense of their own happiness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mechanical Hound:</strong>The Mechanical Hound represents the government's control through technology. It shows how people are dehumanized and manipulated to keep order.</li>
                    <li><strong>The People on the Subway:</strong> These individuals are Brainwashed by the government. Their lack of awareness of the world around them represents the profound impact of censorship and propaganda in shaping society.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="symbolism">
            <h3>Symbolism</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Sieve and the Sand:</strong> The sieve represents Montag’s struggle to preserve knowledge in a society that seeks to obliterate it. The sand slipping through his fingers reflects his frustration with trying to find something meaningful in a world where ideas are constantly being suppressed.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Bible:</strong> The Bible, representing forbidden knowledge, symbolizes Montag’s last chance for something real in a world of lies. He views it as a key to understanding and hopes to protect it from being destroyed by censorship.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Subway and Denham’s Dentifrice:</strong> The constant bombardment of commercials represents the way the government distracts and controls the populace, preventing any meaningful reflection or deep thinking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Faber’s Earpiece:</strong> Faber’s earpiece symbolizes the power of guidance and connection in a time when people are disconnected from their true selves. It guides Montag as he struggles to understand and challenge the oppressive systems in society.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="themes">
            <h3>Themes and Connection to Today</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fear of Change:</strong> Fear of change permeates the characters’ decisions. Just as Montag and others struggle to embrace transformation, today’s society often resists progress, clinging to familiar but outdated systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manipulation:</strong> The government’s use of propaganda to control and numb the population mirrors how modern media can manipulate individuals, shaping their beliefs and actions without their full awareness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choosing Action:</strong> Montag and Faber must decide whether to risk everything to change their world. This theme mirrors real-life situations where people must choose between staying quiet or taking action to stand up for what they believe in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Value of Guidance:</strong> Faber’s mentorship of Montag highlights the importance of seeking guidance in times of uncertainty. This theme highlights the importance of having mentors, teachers, or leaders who guide individuals through difficult moral decisions.</li>
                </ul>
