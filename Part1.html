            <h3>Important Characters</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Guy Montag:</strong> Alienation. Montag begins to feel out of place as he questions his role as a fireman in a society that burns books. His internal journey leads him to realize that there is more to life than following orders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clarisse McClellan:</strong> Curiosity. Clarisse is different from others in society. She asks questions, observes her surroundings, and encourages Montag to look at the world with a similar view to hers, sparking his journey to self-discovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mildred Montag:</strong> Spiritually Empty. Mildred, Montag's wife, is obsessed with watching TV and is disconnected from any meaningful emotions or relationships. She represents the emptiness of a society focused only on entertainment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Captain Beatty:</strong> Obedience. Beatty is the fire chief who knows a lot about books but upholds the government’s rule of censorship. He uses his intelligence to suppress others, showing the conflict between knowledge and obedience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mechanical Hound:</strong> Suppression. The Hound is a robotic enforcer used to track down and intimidate rule breakers. It represents the oppressive control the government exerts through technology and fear.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Woman Who Died in the Fire:</strong> Resistance. This woman chooses to die with her books rather than live in a world that forbids knowledge. Her act of defiance is a turning point for Montag, inspiring him to question the system. (Make a change)</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Symbolism</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Hearth and the Salamander:</strong> The hearth symbolizes warmth and security, while the salamander represents firemen. Together, they highlight fire's dual nature, serving as both a force of destruction and a source of comfort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Books:</strong> Books are a symbol of knowledge, freedom, and individuality. They represent the very things that the government seeks to destroy and suppress, but also the power to change and resist.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fire:</strong> In the story, fire symbolizes both destruction and change. While it’s used to burn books and eliminate ideas, it also represents Montag’s personal transformation and his ability to evolve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mechanical Hound:</strong> The Hound represents the loss of humanity, as it is a tool of suppression and fear, showing how technology is used to control and dehumanize society.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clarisse McClellan:</strong> Clarisse symbolizes curiosity, youth, and a desire for deeper understanding. She contrasts with the rest of society, reminding Montag of what it means to truly live and think freely.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Themes and Connection to Today</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Technology in the story distracts people from meaningful thought, similar to how modern technology, like social media, can prevent deep reflection and focus on important issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alienation:</strong> Montag’s growing sense of alienation reflects how people today can feel disconnected from the world around them, despite being constantly connected through technology and media.</li>
                    <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> The characters in the book live in isolation due to their obsession with entertainment, mirroring how excessive screen time and media consumption can lead to social isolation in today’s world. (Many people in the world like this, very common)</li>
                    <li><strong>Censorship:</strong> The book-burning society in Fahrenheit 451 serves as a warning against censorship, highlighting the importance of free expression in a world where access to information can be controlled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pleasure vs. Fulfillment:</strong> The society in Fahrenheit 451 prioritizes fleeting pleasures, such as entertainment, over true fulfillment, a theme that resonates with today’s struggle between chasing instant gratification and seeking lasting purpose. (I am sometimes living proof of this theme)</li>
                </ul>
